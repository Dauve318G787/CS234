        <p id="METAR"> </p>
        
        <button type="button" class="metar_explain_button">How do I read a METAR?</button>
        <div class="metar_explain">
            <p>A typical METAR is formatted like this:</p>
            <p>KMDH 152052Z 36005KT 10SM FEW043 31/22 A2992 RMK (other stuff)</p>
            <p>KMDH is the airport this METAR is being reported at.</p>
            <p>15 represents the day of the month the METAR was issued on (in this case, the 15th of the month), and 2052Z represents the Zulu time 
                at which the METAR was issued (in this case, 20:52 hours or 8:52 PM).
            </p>
            <p>36005KT represents the wind direction and speed. In this case, the winds are out of a heading of 360,
                and the wind speed is 5 knots. If the wind speed is below 10 knots, the speed will include a leading zero (hence, 05 equals 5). If there are gusts reported,
                the gust speed will be included on the METAR, prefixed by the capital letter G. For example, 36005G15KT means the winds are out of a heading of 360
                degrees, the wind speed is 5 knots, and the gust speed is 15 knots.
            </p>
            <p>10SM represents the visibility. In this case, the visibility is 10 statute miles.</p>
            <p>FEW043 represents the cloud cover. In this case, there are few clouds at 4,300 feet above ground level.</p>
            <p>31/22 represents the temperature/dewpoint in Celsius (respectively).</p>
            <p>A2992 represents the altimeter setting. In this case, the altimeter setting is 29.92.</p>
            <p>RMK and anything after it represents additional remarks.</p>

        <h3>Per FAR 61.3, you are required to carry certain documents with you to act as pilot in command. These documents are: </h3>
        <ul>
            <strong><li>Your pilot certificate</li></strong>
            <strong><li>A photo ID</li></strong>
            <p>Valid forms of identification include a driver's license, state ID, passport, or military ID. 
                Your SIU student ID is NOT a valid form of identification. For more information, refer to FAR 61.3.
            </p>
            <strong><li>A valid medical certificate.</li></strong>
            <p>If you are under the age of 40, all three medical certificates are valid for flight training purposes for 60 calendar months.</p>
            <strong><li>A valid solo logbook endorsement (if operating as a solo student pilot).</li></strong>
        </ul>

        <h3>Per FAR 91.103, you are required to gather certain information prior to departing on a flight. These items include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Weather reports and forecasts</li>
            <li>Fuel requirements</li>
            <li>Alternate airports</li>

        <h2 class="section_start"> IMSAFE </h2>
        <h3>This checklist allows you to take a granular look at your current wellbeing and fitness to fly.</h3>
        <strong><p> Illness: </strong> Are you sick? </p>
        <strong><p> Medication: </strong> Are you taking medication that impairs your ability to flying?</p>
        <strong><p> Stress: </strong> Are you stressed to a degree that will interfere with your ability to fly? </p>
        <strong><p> Alcohol: </strong> Have you had a drink within the past 8 hours? Do you feel hung over?</p>
        <strong><p> Fatigue:</strong> Are you tired to the point where you can't fly safely? </p>
        <strong><p> Emotion:</strong> Is it just not your day? </p>
        <p>If ANY of these are true for you, DO NOT FLY!! </p>

        <h2 class="section_start"> PAVE </h2>
        <h3>The PAVE checklist is a great way to assess the risks of a flight</h3>
        <strong><p> Pilot: </strong> This is the "you factor." Are you fit to fly? Are you comfortable with the conditions? Are you rated for the aircraft you're flying? </p>
        <strong><p> Aircraft: </strong> This focuses on the aircraft you will be flying. Is it airworthy? Will it work for your mission? </p>
        <strong><p> enVironment: </strong> This focuses on the environment you will be flying in. What is the weather like? Have you flown in this weather? Are you comfortable flying SOLO (not dual) in this weather?</p>
        <strong><p> External Pressures: </strong> This is the "everything else" factor. What's motivating you to do this flight? Why are you flying? Is anyone depending on you to make this flight? </p>
    
    <h2 class="section_start"> Weather Calls </h2>
    <p> Throughout the day, SIU Aviation Duty Officers will observe current weather conditions and make weather calls based on those observations.
    </p>
    <p> Please note that these weather calls are BY NO MEANS an end-all-be-all and it is up to the student to evaluate the weather conditions present, determine if they fall within their personal minimums,
        and make a go/no-go decision as appropriate. Just because you CAN go, doesn't mean you SHOULD go. </p>

        <h3 class="section_start">Getting Started</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, you will need to be accepted into the aviation program. More information on the admissions process can be found
            <a href="https://aviation.siu.edu/management/aas-avf/admissions.php">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>After you are admitted to the university, your application will be placed in the aviation program's applicant pool.
            Once you are admitted to the aviation program, you may proceed to the next step.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section_start">Registering for Classes</h3>
        <p>As an aviation major, your class schedule will consist of general education requirements, a flight course, and a ground instruction course.
           To kick off the registration process, you will meet with your academic advisor. They will guide you through the registration process, draft a
           list of courses for you, and will answer any questions you may have. Once your meeting has concluded, you will receive a RUN (Registration User Number),
           which you will use to access the registration portal within SalukiNet. This is the portal in which you will register for classes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section_start">All About Flight Blocks</h3>
        <p> Your flight courses will meet during predetermined time periods known as flight blocks. Each flight block is two hours in length and are named based on their start time.
            For example, the flight block starting at 7 AM is known as the "7 AM flight block." See the below table for specifics.

        <h3 class="section_start"> Stage/Graduation Checks</h3>
        <p> At the end of every flight course, the student will undergo a Stage/Graduation Check with the Chief Flight
            Instructor or an Assistant Chief Flight Instructor.
            Stage/Graduation Checks consist of an oral exam and flight exam, just like an FAA checkride. Students must
            satisfactorily complete all Areas of Operation
            for their particular Check in order for the exam to be considered satisfactory. Learn more about stage checks
            and checkrides by clicking this link <a href="checkride.html">here.</a>

        <p>Although course progression throughout the flight program is strictly linear, you may be able to skip certain flight courses if you already have flight experience
            upon entering the program. Visit <a href="courses.html">this</a> page for more information.
